## Air Quality Data Analysis
## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and cleaning an air quality dataset. The main objective is to perform data cleaning, including handling missing values and outliers, normalizing the data, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA). The cleaned data is then ready for further analysis or machine learning applications.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains air quality measurements collected at various times. The key variables in the dataset include:

Ozone: Ozone concentration (parts per billion)
Solar.R: Solar radiation (langley)
Wind: Wind speed (mph)
Temp: Temperature (degrees Fahrenheit)
Month: Month (1 = January, 2 = February, ..., 12 = December)
Day: Day of the month (1-31)
Source
The dataset is assumed to be from a standard air quality dataset, such as the airquality dataset commonly used in R or Python for educational purposes. If this dataset is from a specific source, please update the source information accordingly.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

airquality.csv: The dataset used for analysis (not included in this repository, you should upload the dataset separately).
data_analysis.py: The Python script that performs data cleaning, normalization, and exploratory data analysis.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Steps Performed
1. Data Loading
The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for analysis:

python
```bash
data = pd.read_csv('airquality.csv')
```
The first few rows of the data are displayed to understand its structure.

2. Handling Missing Values
Missing values in the Ozone, Solar.R, and Wind columns are imputed using the mean of each column:
```bash
data['Ozone'] = data['Ozone'].fillna(data['Ozone'].mean())
data['Solar.R'] = data['Solar.R'].fillna(data['Solar.R'].mean())
data['Wind'] = data['Wind'].fillna(data['Wind'].mean())
```
This ensures that the dataset is complete and ready for further analysis.

3. Outlier Detection and Removal
Outliers in the Ozone, Solar.R, and Wind columns are detected and removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method:

```bash
def remove_outliers(df, column):
    Q1 = df[column].quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = df[column].quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
    return df[(df[column] >= lower_bound) & (df[column] <= upper_bound)]

data_clean = remove_outliers(data, 'Ozone')
```
This step improves the quality of the dataset by removing anomalous values that could skew the analysis.

4. Descriptive Statistics
Summary statistics for the cleaned data are computed and displayed:

python
```bash
summary_stats = data_clean.describe()
```
These statistics provide insights into the distribution and central tendency of the data.

5. Data Normalization
The cleaned data is normalized using Min-Max Scaling to bring all features into the range [0, 1]:

python
```bash
data_normalized = (data_clean - data_clean.min()) / (data_clean.max() - data_clean.min())
```
Normalization is crucial for many machine learning algorithms to perform optimally.

6. Data Visualization
Several visualizations are created to explore the relationships between variables and detect any remaining issues:

Pairplot: Shows pairwise relationships between variables.
Boxplot: Highlights the distribution of the cleaned data and any remaining outliers.
python
```bash
sns.pairplot(data_clean)
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.boxplot(data=data_clean)
```
7. Statistical Testing
A t-test is performed to compare the means of Ozone levels before and after data cleaning:

python
```bash
from scipy import stats
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(data['Ozone'].dropna(), data_clean['Ozone'])
```
This test determines if the data cleaning process significantly altered the mean values.

## Conclusion
The air quality data has been successfully cleaned, and missing values have been imputed with the mean.
Outliers have been detected and removed, resulting in a more reliable dataset.
Data normalization was performed, preparing the data for use in machine learning models.
Visualization and statistical testing provided insights into the data distribution and the impact of cleaning.
The cleaned and processed data is now ready for further analysis, modeling, or other applications.
